# Digital Talent 2022 Workshop Assignments

This repository contains my assignments from the Digital Talent 2022 workshop, organized by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. These assignments showcase a range of data science and machine learning skills and techniques.

## Assignments

The repository consists of three main projects:

### 1. Time Series Prediction (Directory: `time_series`)

This project involves predicting the Google stock price using time series analysis. I used statistical and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that could forecast the stock prices.

* _Languages and Libraries_: Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### 2. Natural Language Processing (Directory: `nlp`)

This assignment involves predicting emotions from sentences using natural language processing techniques. I used sentiment analysis to classify the sentences into different emotions.

* _Languages and Libraries_: Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, keras, TensorFlow

### 3. Neural Network Challenge (Directory: `neural_network_challenge`)

In this project, I used deep learning to predict a driver's behavior based on a set of pictures. The challenge was to build a convolutional neural network that could effectively learn from these images to make accurate predictions.

* _Languages and Libraries_: Python, keras, TensorFlow

## Getting Started
